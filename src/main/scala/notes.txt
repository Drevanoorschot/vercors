===== 14.7.2015
- assert(true ? false : true) gets recorded twice
- Weird behaviour when assertions fail (see my_test_Branching.sil)
- documentation: comments? guide enough?
- domains? (names.sil)
- CondExp in Producer/Consumer?




===== 30.6.2015
- Join in DOT-representation, similar construct in logger needed?
- Unique number per method/predicate/function; hashtag of mpf as initial counter. Problems?
- twice(twice(1))?

===== 16.6.2015
- Imports so that Î£(...) works in set_main?
- Executor/Conditionalblock: Okay to omit exec->leave->follows... and just do the eval/branch?
- Safe to assume that there is ALWAYS an else-branch?


===== 9.6.2015
- Failed assertions etc. still produce meaningless output
- Discussed solution for multiple-collapse-problem when branching:
  Exchanging stacks/saving pointers only in brancher would
  probably not work; workaround-solution: Each SEP gets an identifier
  during insertion, collapse is only executed once per identifier
- If/Else-Branching: Maybe separate construct?

===== 3.6.2015
- Giving state as argument: State expects parameters (?)
- expressions to evaluate/produce/consume: Which to sort out

===== 20.5.2015
- consume/produce: Can't replace insert without additional calls of insert (at consumes/produces)
- Implies in Produce: Branching - how?

===== 13.5.2015
- branch: seems to be called in certain evaluations (e.g., evaluate (a == 1) || (a == 2))
- ConditionalBlock
- produce/consume: pre/postconditions
