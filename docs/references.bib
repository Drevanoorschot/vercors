@inproceedings{OHearnYR04,
	Abstract = {We investigate proof rules for information hiding,
                  using the recent formalism of separation logic. In
                  essence, we use the separating conjunction to
                  partition the internal resources of a module from
                  those accessed by the module's clients. The use of a
                  logical connective gives rise to a form of dynamic
                  partitioning, where we track the transfer of
                  ownership of portions of heap storage between
                  program components. It also enables us to enforce
                  separation in the presence of mutable data
                  structures with embedded addresses that may be
                  aliased.},
