* Change Silicon context s.t. lhs-heaps are stored in there. Consuming permissions
  should then first check if lhs-heaps are given (and if so, try to take permissions
  from there), and if not, take permissions from the current heap (Ïƒ.h).
  DefaultContext.reserveHeaps should then become lhsHeaps.
  
* Do we want to support "requires P(x)" instead of "requires acc(P(x))"?
  Our wands paper uses the syntax, but it is not actually supported by Silicon.
  Did we already discuss this in a Semper meeting?
  "unfolding P(x)" is supported.
  
* NOT (only) WANDS: When requiring acc(x.f) twice, fcs in the heap compressor
  looks strange, because it contains x.f |-> _ # W and x.f |-> _ # W+W even
  twice.
  
* Attach names to heaps, e.g, "lhs 61:10" or "foot 61:10" or "current heap"
