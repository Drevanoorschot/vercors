=======

This Git banch of VerCors hosts VeyMont, a tool for verification of concurrent message passing programs. VeyMont has been build on top of VerCors.

## Case Studies
The global programs of the case studies can be found in the directory `examples/verymont-global-programs`.
The files generated by VeyMont on decomposition can be found in the directory `examples/verymont-local-programs`.

## Installation: Building from source code
When building VerCors and VeyMont, you additionally need these dependencies:

- A Java _Development_ Kit, version 11 or greater, either OpenJDK or Oracle.
- Git (on Windows you need Git Bash, see <https://git-scm.com/downloads>)
- Scala SBT, version 1.3.0 or greater (see <http://www.scala-sbt.org> for instructions)

1. Clone this Git branch using `git clone https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors.git`, move into the cloned directory, `cd vercors`, and switch to the VeyMont branch using `git checkout session-generation`.
2. Run `sbt compile` to compile VerCors.
3. Test whether the build was successful by running `./bin/vct --test=examples/manual --tool=silicon --lang=pvl,java --progress`.

The last command tests the VerCors installation by verifying a large collection of examples (from the `./examples` directory). This command should eventually report that `all ? tests passed`. There are also intstructions for importing VerCors into either eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA [here](https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki).


## Running VerCors and VeyMont
The VerCors tool can be used by running:

 `./bin/vct --silicon <filepath>`, with `<filepath>` the path of the file to verify.

The VeyMont tool can be used by running:

 `./bin/vct --veymont <filepath-to-output-file-for-local-programs> <filepath-to-global-program>`

VerCors verifies programs that are annotated with JML-style specifications (the underlying theory uses separation logic with permission accounting). Details on the specification language can be found on the VerCors [Wiki pages](https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/wiki). Furthermore, a large collection of example programs can be found (and verified) in the `/examples` directory. In particular, example global programs for VeyMont can be found in `examples/veymont-global-programs`.

Local program LTSes are stored in `.aut` files at the same location as the file for the local programs. They can be viewed using the mCRL2 (https://www.mcrl2.org) command `ltsgraph <filepath-to-LTSfile>`.

## Source code
All VeyMont specific source code can be found in the directory `src/main/java/vct/col/veymont`
